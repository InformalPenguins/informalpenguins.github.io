#### Le Gatuno

Originally made during GBJAM5.

Le Gatuno is a platform game with a little bit of strategy. The main task is to help the cat to reach the fish before the time runs out, as secondary mission you can collect the 3 stars available in each stage.
The game mechanics are simple, the cat runs by itself and will jump at your command. Hence, the input is basically one button.
